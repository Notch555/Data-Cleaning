# Data-Cleaning

## Data Cleaning with Microsoft Excel / Power Query

### The aim of this project:
Data integrity or consistency is an important aspect of data analytics because a dirty or inconsistent data can lead to poor analysis. Imagine working for an accounting firm as a data analyst and you are tasked with the job of analyzing their quarterly generated data that will help understand their growth and KPI.
The problem is not the analysis, but the consistency of the data used for the analysis. A dirty data will make all your findings and analysis incorrect, and if the firm uses your findings from an inconsistent data to make decisions it will in return lead to a catastrophic outcome. 
The necessity of a clean data cannot be over emphasized because it is the skeleton to your analysis.

#### Task 1
Extract just the first name from the Name column.

* Solution:
This can be achieved by creating a new column called "first name" and then type out the first names till an auto fill option is given by excel that will reduce the stress of typing out the names individually. 
This functionality is call "FLASH FILL".

* Limitation
The limitations of flash fill is the ability to include the error data in the auto fill, and it is manual.
